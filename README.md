# Automated Backup System Using AWS S3 and Lambda

This repository contains an automated backup system that uses **AWS S3** and **AWS Lambda** to automatically copy files uploaded to one S3 bucket (source bucket) to another S3 bucket (backup bucket). This ensures that your data is automatically backed up every time a new file is added to the source bucket.

## Overview

This system automates the process of backing up files using AWS services. The Lambda function is triggered automatically whenever a new file is uploaded to the source S3 bucket. It then copies the file to a backup S3 bucket.

### Features:
- Automatically backs up any file uploaded to the source bucket.
- Uses AWS Lambda to handle the automation.
- Simple to set up and cost-effective.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **AWS Account**: Set up with access to **AWS Lambda** and **S3**.
- **IAM Role with Permissions**: Create an IAM role that grants Lambda access to the S3 buckets.

---

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the automated backup system:

### Step 1: Create AWS S3 Buckets

1. Go to the **S3 Console** in AWS.
2. **Create a Source Bucket**:
   - Click **Create Bucket** and give it a unique name (e.g., `my-source-bucket`).
   - Leave the default settings or adjust based on your requirements.
   - Click **Create**.
3. **Create a Backup Bucket**:
   - Repeat the above steps to create the backup bucket (e.g., `my-backup-bucket`).

### Step 2: Create Lambda Function

1. Go to the **Lambda Console** and click **Create Function**.
2. Choose **Author from Scratch**.
3. Give the function a name (e.g., `FileBackupLambda`).
4. Choose **Python 3.x** as the runtime (or another language if preferred).
5. Click **Create Function**.

### Step 3: Write Lambda Function Code

### Step 4: Set IAM Role Permissions

Your Lambda function needs permissions to interact with both the source and backup S3 buckets. Set up an **IAM Role** with the following policies:
- **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess**: Grants Lambda permission to read from the source bucket.
- **AmazonS3FullAccess**: Grants Lambda permission to write to the backup bucket.

To create an IAM role:
1. Go to the **IAM Console**.
2. Create a new role with the **Lambda** service as the trusted entity.
3. Attach the above policies to the role.
4. Assign the role to your Lambda function under the **Configuration** tab.

### Step 5: Configure S3 Event Notification

Set up an event notification to trigger the Lambda function when a new file is uploaded to the source bucket:
1. Go to the **S3 Console** and select your source bucket.
2. In the **Properties** tab, scroll down to **Event notifications**.
3. Click **Create event notification**.
4. Select **Lambda function** as the destination and choose your Lambda function (`FileBackupLambda`).
5. Set the event type to **All object create events**.

### Step 6: Test the System

To test the system:
1. Upload a file to your source S3 bucket.
2. Check your backup S3 bucket to confirm that the file was automatically copied.
3. View **AWS Lambda Logs** in **CloudWatch** to ensure the function executed correctly.

---

## Usage

Once the system is set up, any new file uploaded to the source bucket will automatically be copied to the backup bucket. You can monitor the Lambda functionâ€™s execution via **CloudWatch Logs** to track backups and any errors.

---

## Monitoring and Logs

1. Go to **CloudWatch Console**.
2. Select **Logs** and find the log group for your Lambda function.
3. Review the logs to check for successful backups or errors in execution.

---

### Notes:

- **Versioning**: You can enable versioning in the backup bucket to store multiple versions of the same file.
- **Notifications**: Configure additional notifications to alert you when backups are completed or if errors occur.
- **Encryption**: You can enable encryption on the backup bucket for enhanced security.
